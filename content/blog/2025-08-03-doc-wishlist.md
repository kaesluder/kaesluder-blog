## Documentation Wishlist

Most of these are things I had to reverse engineer refactoring a wizard component. And I'll probably forget all of this in six months when I'm asked to do a bugfix.

### Module Level (README.md)

- What are the UI frameworks and dependencies, and where can I find documentation?
- What are the build requirements and process?
- What are needed environment variables?

### Linked Components (README.folder.md)

- What is the goal or task?
- Is there a component hierarchy? What is it?

### Functions

- Description: What is the business/ui purpose of this function?
- Parameters
- Return values
- Error handling
- Exceptions
- Events
- Side effects/state changes

## August Goals

- Get a deeper understanding of how JavaScript handles fundamental variables and functions.
- Continue learning Czech.
- Finish bell hooks, *All About Love*
