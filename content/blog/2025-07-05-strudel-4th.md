## Strudel: Learning to Understand cat, seq, and stack

I've been experimenting with music programming languages. This week it's been [strudel](https://strudel.cc/) which is built around the concept of a cycle&mdash;typically either a measure or a beat in most music notation.

Strudel interprets strings that represent sequences of notes, drumbeats, or other events. "c4 e4 g4" plays three notes of a c-major chord. But a tricky matter is determining how the notes should be interpreted. Does that fit in one cycle (fast) or three cycles (slow)? After a fair bit of frustration, I learned the following concepts for strudel. Something that tripped me up here was that the Strudel docs teach the abbreviated notation first.

* `cat` (`"<c4 e4 g4>"`): treats each item in the list as a separate cycle. This can be used to create extended phrases or songs. This is also known as `slowcat` if you're using the long notation.
* `seq` (`"c4 e4 g4"`): processes each item in the list inside one cycle. This is used to push notes inside a measure. (Also known as `fastcat`).
* `stack` (`"c4, e4, g4"`): process each event in parallel and at the same time. Used for chords, but also having multiple instruments playing together.

Patterns can be nested inside each other. The example below is a simple Strauss waltz loop that consists of four sequences `[bd rim rim]` inside a cat `<[bd rim rim] ...>`.

Here's the logic in flowchart form.

{% mermaid %}
flowchart TD
    Start["I want to play notes..."]
    Choice1{"... at the same time?"}
    Stack["stack"]
    Choice2{"... over multiple cycles?"}
    Cat["cat"]
    Seq["seq"]

    Start --> Choice1
    Choice1 -- Yes --> Stack
    Choice1 -- No --> Choice2
    Choice2 -- Yes --> Cat
    Choice2 -- No --> Seq
{% endmermaid %}


## New Role

Starting in October I'll transition from contract to full time software development at Prime Revenue focused on JS. It's been a four-year journey and I'm very thankful for all the people at Ada Developer's Academy, Amazon, and Prime Revenue who have given me valuable support, advice, and learning opportunities.

## Getting Mermaid on This Page

In the template `base.njk`, add the code to load and run the mermaid api.

```nunjucks
{%- if mermaid %}
<script type="module" eleventy:ignore>
  import mermaid from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid@11/dist/mermaid.esm.min.mjs';
</script>
{%- endif %}
```

Create a paired shortcode in `eleventy.config.js` to explicitly format the code block:

```js
eleventyConfig.addPairedShortcode("mermaid", function (content) {
	return `<pre class="mermaid">${content}</pre>`;
});
```

Use the shortcode to wrap the mermaid code in a `<pre>` block in the post markdown.

{% raw %}
```md
{% mermaid %}
flowchart TD
    Start["I want to play notes..."]
    Choice1{"... at the same time?"}
    Stack["stack"]
    Choice2{"... over multiple cycles?"}
    Cat["cat"]
    Seq["seq"]

    Start --> Choice1
    Choice1 -- Yes --> Stack
    Choice1 -- No --> Choice2
    Choice2 -- Yes --> Cat
    Choice2 -- No --> Seq
{% endmermaid %}
```
{% endraw %}
