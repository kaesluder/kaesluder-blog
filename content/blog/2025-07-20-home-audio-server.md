Prepping for a move in October and working on digitizing old cds and setting up a backup server. Not creative work but productive.

- Raspberry Pi 4 running [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/). The Pi was left over from another project a few years ago. Setting it up for headless operation was pretty easy following instructions. Using an external HDD and an enclosure, also from an earlier project.
- Basic [Samba](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-and-configure-samba) setup with a `Music` folder.
- [Navidrome](https://www.navidrome.org/) music server.
- Ripping: [Asunder](http://littlesvr.ca/asunder/) and [Musicbrainz Picard](https://picard.musicbrainz.org/) for tagging/organization.

A goal is to move away from depending on streaming services to personal music curation. Some of the discoveries from the archives include some independently published local music by hometown bands like [Salaam](https://www.salaamband.com/) and a Live From Bloomington project I've not found on the internet. Also discovering CDs I didn't know we had, like three Beatles collections and a Siouxsie and the Banshees single.

I started a practice in spring of putting notable songs on a year playlist. It just crossed 100 songs:
